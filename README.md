# Center Dot

Center Dot is a Windows application that renders a dot in the center of the screen. It is useful for PC games that do not provide a crosshair.

Note that this only works, when using the "borderless window" mode of games, as CenterDot is only a "Windows window" that places itself over the game window and stays on top. Adding a crosshair to a game in fullscreen mode would require more DirectX hacking and may be suspicous to anti-cheat engines.

## Usage

Start CenterDot.exe.
A little crosshair should appear on the screen.
The crosshair should stay visible in games using borderless window mode.

When the program is running it does not appear in the task bar but is accessible as a notification icon via the systray (notification bar):

From there you can access a context menu using right click on the icon. 

The dot can be shown/hidden using the menu entry. 
There is also a shortcut/hotkey to show/hide the crosshair in-game: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd>

Using the option "Adjust dot" you can move the crosshair/dot to another position using the arrow keys on your keyboard. When done, click the menu entry "Adjust dot" again to disable the adjustment mode.

Using the option "Reset dot" the dot is re-aligned to the center of your primary screen.

The context menu entry "Exit" quits the application and removes the crosshair.
